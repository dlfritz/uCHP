MicroCHP Simulation

This simulation is a modular micro CHP code designed in Scipy to act as an 
interchangeable CHP simulation adjustable to different system layouts. Each 
module is written as a function with its own inputs, all interchangable modules 
can be exchanged in a "plug and play" fashion. Hybrid power generation units 
involving energy storage can by any combination of Sterling engines, internal 
combustion engines, gas turbines, fuel cells, photo voltaic and wind turbines.
