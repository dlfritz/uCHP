# Purpose of this function:
# This function is designed to simulate a ÂµCHP system with various configurations.
# The available configurations are (will include) electric generation capabilities
# through a hybrid high temp fuel cell, PEM fuel cell coupled with either an
# internal combustion engine, a sterling engine or a gas turbine. Alternatively
# the fuel cell component can also be completely removed and a standard internal
# combustion engine, sterling engine or gas turbine can be used for power
# generation.
#
# Stand of Simulation:
#                       Under development/Not functioning
#
# Work to be completed:
#                       -Develop outline and flow chart
#                       -Determine desired inputs and outputs
#                       -Focus on modular coding to promote easy model replacement and cross-functionality
#                       -Develop individual component modules
#                           -Fuel Cell
#                           -Compressor
#                           -Turbine...etc.
